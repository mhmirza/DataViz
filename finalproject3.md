# Final Project: Part 3

## Summary

This page provides a summary of how I navigated through different steps to develop a data-driven story, "Fast Fashion: the hidden costs." While this topic has come under discussion in many countries, with customers pressing on brands to be more transparent about their supply chain, I believe there is still lack of awareness regarding the environmental and social repercussions of shaking hands with fast fashion. 

In a mostly price sensitive and disposable society, where instant gratification has now been made possible through e-commerce, the conversation about customers making careful purchase decisions is likely to fall on deaf ears. However, through this story I wish to present evidence based arguments to unveil the damaging consequences of fast fashion, a trend plaguing the retail environment.  

## Part 1

In the first part of the project, for my narrative structure I relied upon the "Setup, Conflict and Resolution" framework discussed in Scott Berinato's book, Good charts: The HBR Guide. This allowed me to break my story down into three high level components: uncovering the retail trends, conveying their implications, and finally calling upon the audience to act. While drafting the outline, I concomitantly ensured that reliable data sources, which were relvant to story were accessible online.

With this high level summary of the project, I sketched rough data visualizations to serve as an opening ground for further refinement in part 2 of the project. These sketches were helpful in allowing me to gauge the strength of the relationship between my reasoning and the visualization. In cases where the visualizations did not support my reasoning, as was the case in my first sketch where a fall in proportional expenditure on clothing is evident, upon further research, I was able to find data which could help explain this scenario as reflected in sketch 2 of the outline.

Finally, with the method and medium identified in this part for story creation, I began working on part 2 of the project using the outline, data sources, sketches from this part.
