# Final Project: Part 3

## Summary

This page provides a summary of how I navigated through different steps to develop a data-driven story, "Fast Fashion: the hidden costs." While this topic has come under discussion in many countries, with customers pressing on brands to be more transparent about their supply chain, I believe there is still lack of awareness regarding the environmental and social repercussions of shaking hands with fast fashion. 

In a mostly price sensitive and disposable society, where instant gratification has now been made possible through e-commerce, the conversation about customers making careful purchase decisions is likely to fall on deaf ears. However, through this story I wish to present evidence based arguments to unveil the damaging consequences of fast fashion, a trend plaguing the retail environment.  

## Part 1

In the first part of the project, for my narrative structure I relied upon the "Setup, Conflict and Resolution" framework discussed in Scott Berinato's book, Good charts: The HBR Guide. This allowed me to break my story down into three high level components: uncovering the retail trends, conveying their implications, and finally calling upon the audience to act. While drafting the outline, I concomitantly ensured that reliable data sources, which were relvant to my story, were accessible online.

With the summary of the project in shape, I sketched data visualizations to serve as an opening ground for further refinement in the next part of the project. These sketches were helpful in allowing me to gauge the strength of the relationship between my reasoning and the visualizations. In some cases, the visualization did not support the premise of my story, as was the case in my first sketch where a fall in proportional expenditure on clothing was evident. In this scenario, I decided to research further to find data which could possibly justify this, as reflected in sketch 2 of the outline. By the end of part 1, I was equipped with the outline, data sources, sketches and story creation medium, which would serve as essential tools for part 2.

## Part 2

In part 2 of the project, I started building the wireframe for my story using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Soon into this process, I realized it would be a better idea to utilize [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/). Since this was the tool I had decided to use for building my final story, I thought it would facilitate better user research as the storyboard would be closer to the look and feel of my final website. The flow of this storyboard was similar to that of my outline in part 1. However, I created data visualizations on [Flourish](/https://flourish.studio/) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) instead of reusing the sketches, due to the flexibly these digital tools offer in editing elements of the graphic in a way that is most suited for communicating effectively. 

After identifying the audience that I hoped to reach through my story, I selected a group of three individuals for my user research with profiles similar to my intended audience. Following this, I used an interview script to identify the elements of the story that I wanted to test, the research objective that I expected to achieve by testing each element, and the set of questions for the interviewees that could help me achieve those objectives. Upon completion of user research, I was able to draw out common patterns of suggestions, which were then incorporated in part 3.

### Design Decisions

The user research from part 3 not only helped me gain a crucial perspective to my story. This was instrumental in not only identifying the changes executed below, but also in helping me revisit important design decisions. 

1. In terms of the use of images, I replaced an image of women's shoes in my original storyboard with that of a man browsing through a store, hoping to alleviate concerns about gender bias in my story. Moreover, to improve the visibility of graphical and textual information and minimze distraction for readers, I increased the darkness of the image overlay and transparency of the images, wherever possible. Finally, I added a subdued image in the background instead of using a dark shade to end the story on a lighter note. 
2. In terms of the visualizations, in the graphic for "Are we spending less on clothes", I replaced the vertical bar chart with a line chart to clearly highlight the declining trend. In addition, I restricted the use of color in the pictogram for "How is The Fast Fashion Market Expected to Grow?" and flipped the timeline for the axis to observe convention. Similarly, for the slope chart on "Brands Are Racing to Keep the "Newness" Factor in Fashion Alive", I switched from using different colors for each slope to only highlighting the slope for Apparel Stores, while moving the rest to the background. Moreover, for the donut chart on "Fashion Research: Survey Results", to reflect the ordinal range of responses, I used complementary shades of blue with the intensity of the color capturing the magnitude of the response.
3. In terms of infographics, to break the monotonous theme of my presentation and in a way give the audience a "fact sheet" to understand the environmental impact of fast fashion, I incorporated the visualizations and textual information into a single infographic made using [Infogram](https://infogram.com/app/#/library). Although the inspiration for this was sought from the source where this information was drawn from, this was an important design decision that I had to make for my story. I created this histogram using relevant icons to protrude key statistics, while balancing the use of red and gray for visualizationos to distinguish important aspects from the unimportant ones. I also tried including the image under the text "Does this mean we are simply wearing plastic?" in this infographic but it undermined the purpose of information dissemination that I intended to achieve here.
