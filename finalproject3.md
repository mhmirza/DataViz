# Final Project: Part 3

## Summary

This page provides an summary of how I navigated through different steps to develop a data-driven story, "Fast Fashion: the hidden costs." While this topic has come under discussion in many countries, with customers pressing on brands to be more transparent about their supply chain, I believe there is still a lack of awareness regarding the environmental and social repercussions of adopting the fast fashion trend. 

In a mostly price sensitive and disposable society, where instant gratification has now been made possible through e-commerce, the conversation about customers making careful purchase decisions is likely to fall on deaf ears. However, through this story I wish to present evidence based arguments to unveil the damaging environmental and social consequences, that can be attributed fast fashion, a trend plaguing the retail environment.
