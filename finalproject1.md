# Part 1: Final Project
This project on the repercussions of the increasing popularity of fast fashion across the globe. The setup of this project is highlight how fast fashion has grown over the years, owing to more frequent and possibly cheaper availability of apparel in recent years. Following this preamble, it would establish a conflict by navigating the audience through specific social and environmental issues associated with the adoption of this trend. Finally, it would suggest a possible resolution to the identified problem by introducing sustainable fashion trends and corrective action required on part of the consumers.

## Project Outline:

### 1. Are people spending more on clothes now?
This section would show how the average expenditure on clothing as a fraction of total retail spending per capita has fallen over the years. This would help negate the premise of the project and build some context regarding how individuals might have a tendency to only assess a part of the story. A visualization would immediately follow showing how prices in the apparel industry have indeed risen at a lower rate compared to other retail items, which explains a fall in proportional expenditures but not necessarily a fall in consumption.

### 2. Is fast fashion leading to excess apparel consumption?
This section intends to convey the scale at which the fast fashion industry is growing along with a forecast of how it is expected to grow. To reinforce the "fast" in fashion, a visualization would highlight how retailers now have to hold growing inventories to keep the "newness" factor in apparel alive. Based on this context, I will try to link how there has also been a corresponding increase in apparel consumption through a stacked bar chart will be shown to convey the percentage of unworn clothes in the wardrobe across different countries. This would hopefully ring the first alarm bell!

### 3. Why should we be concerned about fast fashion?
Brands are dumping more than half of what they are producing. To establish credibility of this claim, I would present an area stacked graph showing the percentage of textiles generated which end up in landfills, questioning the viability of the fast fasion trend. Moreover, PP & A (polyester, polyamide, and acrylic) and fibres, which are the primary raw materials for clothing, are the third biggest contributor to the global plastic production. This explains why synthetic textiles occupy the greatest segment of the pie for global releases of primary microplastics to the world oceans.
