# Part 1: Final Project
This project on the repercussions of the increasing popularity of fast fashion across the globe. The setup of this project is to highlight how fast fashion has grown over the years, owing to more frequent and possibly cheaper availability of apparel in recent years. Following this preamble, it would establish a conflict by navigating the audience through specific social and environmental issues associated with the adoption of this trend. Finally, it would suggest a possible resolution to the identified problem by introducing sustainable fashion trends and corrective action required on part of the consumers.

## Project Outline:

### 1. Are people spending more on clothes now?
This section would show how the average expenditure on clothing as a fraction of total retail spending per capita has fallen over the years. This would help negate the premise of the project and build some context regarding how individuals might have a tendency to only assess a part of the story. A visualization would immediately follow showing how prices in the apparel industry have indeed risen at a lower rate compared to other retail items, which explains a fall in proportional expenditures but not necessarily a fall in consumption.
