# Part 1: Final Project
This project on the repercussions of the increasing popularity of fast fashion across the globe. The setup of this project is highlight how fast fashion has grown over the years, owing to more frequent and possibly cheaper availability of apparel in recent years. Following this preamble, it would establish a conflict by navigating the audience through specific social and environmental issues associated with the adoption of this trend. Finally, it would suggest a possible resolution to the identified problem by introducing sustainable fashion trends and corrective action required on part of the consumers.

## Project Outline:

### 1. Are people spending more on clothes now?
This section would show how the average expenditure on clothing as a fraction of total retail spending per capita has fallen over the years. This would help negate the premise of the project and build some context regarding how individuals might have a tendency to only assess a part of the story. A visualization would immediately follow showing how prices in the apparel industry have indeed risen at a lower rate compared to other retail items, which explains a fall in proportional expenditures but not necessarily a fall in consumption.

### 2. Is fast fashion leading to excess apparel consumption?
This section intends to convey the scale at which the fast fashion industry is growing along with a forecast of how it is expected to grow. To reinforce the "fast" in fashion, a visualization would highlight how retailers now have to hold growing inventories to keep the "newness" factor in apparel alive. Based on this context, I will try to link how there has also been a corresponding increase in apparel consumption through a stacked bar chart will be shown to convey the percentage of unworn clothes in the wardrobe across different countries. Another possible visualization which could be used here is a scatter plot, which would show that a significant fraction of respondents from a survey conducted across different neighbourhoods of a Middle Eastern country owned more than 200 items of clothes. This would hopefully ring the first alarm bell! 

### 3. Why should we be concerned about fast fashion?
Brands are dumping more than half of what they are producing. To establish credibility of this claim, I would present an area stacked graph showing the percentage of textiles generated which end up in landfills, questioning the viability of the fast fasion trend. Moreover, PP & A (polyester, polyamide, and acrylic) and fibres, which are the primary raw materials for clothing, are the third biggest contributor to the global plastic production. This explains why synthetic textiles occupy the greatest segment of the pie for global releases of primary microplastics to the world oceans. A bar chart reflecting the carbon footprint of leading European apparel retailers would be shown here to help the audience understand the environmentally irresponsible attitude of popular brands. Finally, I would discuss the role of child labour involved with cotton imports into the European Union, which are mainly used in apparel manufacturing. This could be represented using a table to highlight the negligence of governments in holding apparel brands responsible.

### 4. Know before you buy.
One garbage truck of clothes are burned or landfilled every second, enough to fill 1.5 Empire State buildings every day! Before you buy a cotton shirt again out of pleasure, remember that it takes 2,700 litres of water to make one of those, which is enough for one person to drink for 2.5 years. Before you buy a pair of Levi's jeans, know that it leads to: climate change, excessive water consumption, eutrophication, land occupation and abiotic depletion. A closing visualization could serve as food for thought here! 

### 5. Call to Action.
McKinsey & Co. has highlighted increasing clothing utilization and improving recycling as two of the four ambitions for a new textile economy, where we as consumers can certainly play a part. It is important for consumers to buy from responsible brands such as Eileen Fisher, who are introducing programs such as ReNew program, through which they accept any of their old clothing back, regardless of the condition. The next time you don't buy a pair of shoes that you don't really need, don't feel disappointed because you have contributed to the environment. This heatmap, showing the savings that could potentially come from averting production of each Kilogram of clothing, can probably make you feel better about the purchase choices that you make. Curtail the demand, and the supply will follow suit!
