### Grid of Line Charts
The grid of line charts below shows how the Debt to GDP ratio varies from 1995 to 2019 across different countries. The dashed vertical line marks the start of the recession in 2007, to provide a comparison of this metric before and after this event.

### Slope Chart
The slope chart below allows us to navigate through the transition of each country across four, consistently spaced time periods. Here, we have highlighted the country with the highest Debt to GDP ratio in 2019 within the sub-region it has been assigned by the United Nations. 

It can be seen below that Greece seems to outperform other countries in Southern Europe. Similarly, USA, France, Great Britain, Hungary and Australia outrun others in their respective regions. The slope chart also enables us to see and compare the ranks for these players between the starting and ending time periods for this data set: 

Country | 1995 Rank | 2019 Rank
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Australia | 5 | 6
France | 4 | 3
Great Britain | 6 | 4
Greece | 1 | 1
Hungary | 3 | 5
United States | 2 | 2
