### Grid of Line Charts

### Slope Chart
The slope chart below allows us to identify the country with the highest Debt to GDP ratio in 2019 within each sub-region, as defined by the United Nations. We can see below that Greece seems to outperform other countries in Southern Europe. Similarly, USA, France Great Britain, Hungary and Australia outrun others in their respective regions.

The slope chart also enables a comparison between the starting point and the ending point. For example, we can see here how these players ranked as follows in 1995: 

Country | 1995 Rank | 2019 Rank
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Australia | 5 | 6
France | 4 | 3
Great Britain | 6 | 4
Greece | 1 | 1
Hungary | 3 | 5
United States | 2 | 2
