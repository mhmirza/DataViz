# In Class Exercise - Tableau

For this excercise, we used the The New York Times data for Covid-19 in the United States, which can be found [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). 

First, I tried to recreate the visualization found on the [newspaper's website](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html#states) using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).
