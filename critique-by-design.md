# Critique By Design
## Part 1: Data Visualization with Reference Data

For this assignment, I chose the following data visualization from this [article](/https://howmuch.net/articles/trade-war-in-6-visualizations). The primary objective of this article is to convey through different data visualizations how the US-China trade war has impacted the health of both economies and brought fear to the global markets. 

I have chosen the data visualization reflecting the Foreign Exchange Reserves of different countries for Q1, 2018. I chose this visualization because of three reasons:
1. Foreign Exchange Reserves are regarded as the health meter of any country, and include assets such as foreign currencies, gold reserves, treasury bills etc. that are retained by the central bank or other federal monetary authority. 
2. The visualization does not support the main premise of the article i.e. gauging the impact of this trade war since it does not inform any trends or changes in forex reserves but provides a snapshot view of this economic indicator for a quarter.
3. The graphic does does not follow principles of good design and has room for improvement across several elements, if evaluated on the heuristics model.

Reference data for foreign exchange reserves of different countries across several years was retrieved using the World Bank's [Data Repository](/https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FI.RES.XGLD.CD).

## Part 3: Wireframe a Solution

I tried using the tool [Balsamiq](/https://balsamiq.com/) to draft my thouoght process. Considering the type of data, I decided to use another visualization type to redesign the map above. I first considered using either a bar or a line chart below, but decided to sketch only the line chart due to the limitations identified with bar charts in representing this data, primarily the absence of historical trends.

### Audience Feedback 

I showed the wireframe to two individuals: my spouse and another former colleague at Central European University.
