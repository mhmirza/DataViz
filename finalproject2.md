# Part 2: Final Project

## Storyboard
For my storyboard, I decided to use [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/) since I felt its functionality would allow me to represent the story in the form that is closest to the final. Not only did it allow me to piece the story together using my outline from [Part 1](/finalproject2.md) of this project, but I thought it would also help the users in navigating through my narrative. The preview link for the storyboard can be found on this **[link]**(https://preview.shorthand.com/i2LOY168IkxSJAyQ), which also included the visualizations made using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/).

## User Research

### Target Audience 
The target audience for my story is individuals who are in favor of making sustainable, socially responsible choices but may not entirely be aware of the repercussions of fast fashion. While most individuals have long recognized climate change and child labor as global issues, fast fashion is a topic which has come under scrutiny only recently. The objective of this website is to make the audience aware that there are many hidden costs to fast fashion than just the price they pay for apparel. Since this is a global trend, I would want people in my user research to have varying demographics e.g. age, education, country of origin, to capture how receptivity and appeal to this narrative varies across fashion consumers from different walks of life. These are the profiles of individuals included in the interview: 

* a male, undergraduate student, aged 19, from Pakistan
* a female, graduate student, aged 29, from China
* a female, graduate student, aged 35 from Italy

### User Research Protocol

The user research protocol that I have used here has been adapted from the one used in class. It has been split into three sections: _what I wish to test_ identifies my intention to capture a specific evaluation metric, _what I expect to achieve_ highlights the purpose of gauging this metric, and _what I will ask_ includes my interview script that could help me understand the audience's perspective regarding the flow of the story, clarity of textual and graphical content and the strength of the narrative.

   What I wish to test   |                What I expect to achieve                 |                What I will ask                
  ------------ | ------------- | -------------
Relevance | To check if the content being presented is relevant to the type of audience and to the topic under discussion | **i)** At first glance, what do you think is the key idea of the presentation? **ii)** Were you already aware of any information that has already been presented here? **iii)** Any elements of this story which came as a surprise to you but have been understated in the narrative?
Emotional appeal | To check if the narrative invoked any positive or negative reactions from the audience | **i)** To what extend do you agree or disagree with the arguments presented here against fast fashion? **ii)** How did you feel as you moved through the different sections of this presentation?

Intention | To check if the overall story is compelling and would drive the users to adopt the call to action | **i)** How effective would you say is the overall story in conveying the demerits of fast fashion? **ii)** Would the narrative make you revisit your apparel purchase choices in the future?
Improvement | To seek user advice on specific elements which need to be changed | If you were to present this story, which elements would you change to make it more coherent and persuasive? Please include any comments about the overall design of the presentation.

### Interview Findings

Question | Person 1 | Person 2 | Person 3                
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
At first glance, what do you think is the key idea of the presentation? | The key idea seems to be that there is a cost associated with cheap fast fashion, that we should be taking account of. | XYZ | XYZ
Were you already aware of any information that has already been presented here? | No, I wasn’t. | XYZ | XYZ
Any elements of this story which came as a surprise to you but have been understated in the narrative? | I didn’t realize there was a decline in clothing expenditure over time, and I found the percentage of unworn clothes in the closet to be even more surprising. Neither were understated though, I felt the visualizations and their place in the story worked well. | XYZ | XYZ
To what extend do you agree or disagree with the arguments presented here against fast fashion? | I was pretty neutral on the topic prior to seeing this presentation, but I am definitely more inclined towards switching to more sustainable brands. | XYZ | XYZ 
How did you feel as you moved through the different sections of this presentation? | A little overwhelmed. I felt there was too much happening in the story. I felt the creator had done a lot of research and wanted to include it all – when he could’ve prioritized. | XYZ | XYZ
Do you think there is any redundant or missing textual information, which disturbs the flow of the story? | No, not really. | XYZ | XYZ 
Is there any graphical information which is unclear, misrepresentative or unfit in this narrative? | There were a few where I felt excessive use of colors in particular was obscuring the ideas: a) How is the fast fashion market expected to grow chart had 3 colours for three years, when a single colour could’ve been easier to visually process. I kept looking for another dimension on which the colours were dependent; b) Brands are racing to keep the newness factor chart I felt also had too many colours and making it difficult for me to focus on any one trend. | XYZ | XYZ
How effective would you say is the overall story in conveying the demerits of fast fashion? | It is very effective! | XYZ | XYZ 
Would the narrative make you revisit your apparel purchase choices in the future? | It would! Especially given the environmental and social cost of it depicted in the story. | XYZ | XYZ
Which elements would you change to make it more coherent and persuasive? Please include any comments about the overall design of the presentation. | a) I think on some pages I felt there were contrast issues. With dark colored image at the back and a dark colored chart on top of it. Maybe use lighter colored images in the background, where possible so there is more focus on the charts; b) Use fewer colors in the above mentioned charts! | XYZ | XYZ

### Changes Based on User Feedback
Based on user research, these are the changes that I would consider for my final project:

**1. Include inclusive imagery:** Users felt that the use of images corresponding to the title of each section helped convey a strong message. However, the choice of images gave a sense that fast fashion has propagated in recent years due to the purchase decisions made by women. To rectify this, I have decided to include/ replace a few images which include gender neutral content and categorically mention in the description for survey visualization that the sample included individuals with varying demographics.
