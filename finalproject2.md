# Part 2: Final Project

## Storyboard
For my storyboard, I decided to use [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/) since I felt its functionality would allow me to represent the story in the form that is closest to the final. Not only did it allow me to piece the story together using my outline from [Part 1](/finalproject2.md) of this project, but I thought it would also help the users in navigating through my narrative. The preview link for the storyboard can be found on this [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/i2LOY168IkxSJAyQ), which also included the visualizations made using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/).

Relevance | To check if the content being presented is relevant to the type of audience and to the topic under discussion | **i)** Were you already aware of any information that has already been presented here? **ii)** Any elements of this story which came as a surprise to you but have been understated in narrative?/
Emotional appeal | To check if the narrative invoked any positive or negative reactions from the audience | **i)** To what extend do you agree or disagree with the arguments presented here against fast fashion? **ii)** How did you feel as you moved through the different sections of this presentation?
Comprehension | To check if the textual and graphical content is reasonably comprehensible and flows coherently for the audience | Do you think there is any redundant or missing textual information, which needs to be removed/altered to knit the story better? Are there any data visualizations which are unclear, misrepresentative or unfit in this narrative?
