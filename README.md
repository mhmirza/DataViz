# DataViz

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Telling Stories with Data**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. It includes data visualization critique, in-class exercises, data visualization workshop and the final project. Links for each of these components have been provided below.

# Key Learnings

From the course, Telling Stories with Data, I learnt how to leverage good design practices and visualization techniques to present data in a compelling manner. Since narrative is the heart of any presentation, I focused on gaining an understanding of how these methods and mediums can be used to form a persuasive, data-driven story. Furthermore, I garnered skills to identify an impactful visualization and constructively critique/ redesign a weak visualization by decomposing its elements.
