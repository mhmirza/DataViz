# About me
Hi, I am Manzoor! I am 27 years old, but I might look much older to you if we ever get to meet. I am a graudate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing Masters in Public Policy and Management: Data Analytics. Prior to joining grad school, I was working with GlaxoSmithKline in their Customer Insights division, based out of Pakistan.

# What I hope to learn?
From the course, Telling Stories with Data, I wish to learn how to utilize different visualization techniques to present data. By the end of the course, I want to be able to decompose the elements that help make a good graphic. I also want to gain exposure to digital tools available online, that could build visualizations and improve their look and feel.
