This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, [Telling Stories with Data](https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses_api/course_detail/94-870/), at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2021. It includes data visualization critique, in-class exercises, data visualization workshop and the final project. Links for each of these components have been provided below.

# About me

Hi, I am Manzoor! I am 27 years old, but I might look much older to you if we ever get to meet. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing Master's in Public Policy and Management: Data Analytics. Prior to joining graduate school, I was working with GlaxoSmithKline in their Customer Insights division, based out of Pakistan.

Before I visualize any data, let me visualize myself. Here is a picture of me from a trip that I took to Langkawi, Malaysia during winter vacations of 2019!

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Telling Stories with Data, I wish to learn how to leverage good design practices and visualization techniques to present data in a compelling manner. Since narrative is the heart of any presentation, I wish to gain an understanding of how these methods and mediums can be used to form a persuasive, data-driven story. By the end of this course, I hope to develop skills which could allow me to identify an impactful visualization and constructively critique/ redesign a weak visualization by decomposing its elements.
